# Insurance Fraud Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information on more than 9000 historical insurance claims. The primary goal is to develop a fraud detection model, create an investigation decision rule to minimize overall expected cost, and evaluate the cost savings achieved through the model.

### Key Achievements
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Randomly sampled 8000 claims from the dataset to ensure diverse analysis.
   - Explained the method used to create the full dataset and assessed its appropriateness for the project.

2. **Fraud Detection Model**
   - Explored relationships using graphical techniques.
   - Fitted a Multiple Regression Model with "Fraud Detected" as the dependent variable.
   - Constructed dummy variables for categorical variables.
   - Interpreted coefficients and p-values, explaining the variable selection process.
   - Used the model to predict fraud in claims, evaluating the classification accuracy.

3. **Investigation Decision Rule**
   - Developed a decision rule for investigating claims, aiming to minimize overall expected cost.
   - Considered Type I and Type II errors, incorporating investigation and fraud costs.
   - Analyzed the model's performance, including the sensitivity to changes in costs.

4. **Cost Savings**
   - Compared the model-driven decision rule with a random investigation scenario.
   - Calculated probabilities of Type I and Type II errors and the total expected cost.
   - Explored potential cost savings achieved by implementing the model.

5. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Proposed considerations for updating the decision rule based on experience and gained information.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates skills in data sampling, regression modelling, decision analysis, and continuous improvement in the context of insurance fraud detection. The developed model and decision rule provide a strategic approach to investigating claims, minimizing costs, and improving overall efficiency.
